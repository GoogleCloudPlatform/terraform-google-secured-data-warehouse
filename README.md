# Secured Data Warehouse Blueprint

[FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md) | [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

This repository contains Terraform configuration modules that allow Google Cloud customers to
quickly deploy a secured [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) data warehouse,
following the [Secure a BigQuery data warehouse that stores confidential data](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/confidential-data-warehouse-blueprint) guide.
The blueprint allows customers
to use Google Cloud's core strengths in data analytics, and to overcome typical
challenges that include:

- Limited knowledge/experience with best practices for creating, deploying, and operating in Google
Cloud.
- Security/risk concerns and restrictions from their internal security, risk, and compliance teams.
- Regulatory and compliance approval from external auditors.

The Terraform configurations in this repository provide customers with an opinionated architecture
that incorporates and documents best practices for a performant and scalable design, combined with
security by default for control, logging and evidence generation. It can be  simply deployed by
customers through a Terraform workflow.

## Disclaimer

When using this blueprint, it is important to understand how you manage [separation of duties](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/separation-of-duties). We recommend you remove all primitive `owner` roles in the projects used as inputs for the *Data Warehouse module*. The secured data warehouse itself does not need any primitive owner roles for correct operations.

When using this blueprint in the example mode or when using this blueprint to create the new projects with default configurations for the deployment, we automatically remove the owner role as it has too broad access.

However, if you choose to use this blueprint with pre-existing projects in your organization, we will not proactively remove any pre-existing owner role assignments, as we wonâ€™t know your intent for or dependency on these role assignments in your pre-existing workloads. The pre-existing presence of these roles does expand the attack and risk surface of the resulting deployment. Therefore, we highly recommend you review your use of owner roles in these pre-existing cases and see if you can eliminate them to improve your resulting security posture. Only you can determine the appropriate trade-off to meet your business requirements.

You can check the current situation of your project with either of the following methods:

- Using [Security Health Analytics](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-vulnerabilities-findings#security-health-analytics-detectors) (SHA), checking the [KMS vulnerability findings](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-vulnerabilities-findings#kms-findings), for the Detector `KMS_PROJECT_HAS_OWNER`.
  - You can search for the SHA findings with category `KMS_PROJECT_HAS_OWNER` in the Security Command Center in the  Google Cloud Console.
- You can also use Cloud Asset Inventory [search-all-iam-policies](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-iam-policies#search_policies) gcloud command doing a [Query by role](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-iam-policies#examples_query_by_role) to search for owner of the project.

See the [terraform-example-foundation](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation) for additional good practices.

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "secured_data_warehouse" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/secured-data-warehouse/google"

  delete_contents_on_destroy       = false
}
```

**Note:** There are three inputs related to GCP Locations in the module:

- `pubsub_resource_location`: is used to define which GCP location will be used to [Restrict Pub/Sub resource locations](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/resource-location-restriction). This policy offers a way to ensure that messages published to a topic are never persisted outside of a Google Cloud regions you specify, regardless of where the publish requests originate. **Zones or multi-region locations are not supported**.
- `location`: is used to define which GCP region will be used for all other resources created: [Cloud Storage buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations), [BigQuery datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations), and [Cloud KMS key rings](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/locations). **Multi-region locations are supported**.
- `trusted_locations`: is a list of locations that are used to set an [Organization Policy](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/defining-locations#location_types) that restricts the GCP locations that can be used in the projects of the Secured Data Warehouse. Both `pubsub_resource_location` and `location` must respect this restriction.

## Requirements

These sections describe requirements for using this module.

**Note:** Please see the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) regarding **project owners** before creating projects.

### Software

Install the following dependencies:

- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) version 357.0.0 or later
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) version 0.13.7 or later
- [Terraform Provider for GCP](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google) version 3.77 or later
- [Terraform Provider for GCP Beta](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google-beta) version 3.77 or later

### Security Groups

Provide the following groups for separation of duty.
Each group is granted roles to perform their tasks.
Then, add users to the appropriate groups as needed.

- **Data Engineer group**: Google Cloud IAM group that sets up and maintains the data pipeline and warehouse.
- **Data Analyst group**: Google Cloud IAM group that analyzes the data in the warehouse.
- **Security Analyst group**: Google Cloud IAM group that monitors and responds to security incidents.
- **Network Administrator group**: Google Cloud IAM group that reviews network configuration. Typically, this includes members of the networking team.
- **Security Administrator group**: Google Cloud IAM group that administers security configurations in the organization(org policies, KMS, VPC service perimeter).

Groups can be created in the Google [Workspace Admin Console](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9400082?hl=en), in the Google [Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/groups-in-cloud-console), and using gcloud identity [groups create](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/identity/groups/create).

### Service Account

To provision the resources of this module, create a privileged service account, where the service account key cannot be created.
In addition, consider using Cloud Monitoring to alert on this service account's activity.
Grant the following roles to the service account.

- Organization level
  - Access Context Manager Admin: `roles/accesscontextmanager.policyAdmin`
  - Organization Policy Administrator: `roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin`
  - Organization Administrator: `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin`

[IAM module](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-iam) in combination to provision a
service account with the necessary roles applied.

The user using this service account must have the necessary roles to [impersonate](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/impersonating-service-accounts) the service account.
