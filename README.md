# Secured Data Warehouse Blueprint

This repository contains Terraform configuration modules that allow customers to
quickly deploy a secured BigQuery data warehouse. The blueprint allows customers
to use Google Cloud's core strengths in data analytics, and to overcome typical
challenges that include:

- Limited knowledge/experience with best practices for creating, deploying and operating in Google
Cloud
- Security/risk concerns and restrictions from their internal security, risk and compliance teams
- Regulatory and compliance approval from external auditors.

The Terraform configurations in this repository provide customers with an opinionated architecture
that incorporates and documents best practices for a performant and scalable design, combined with
security by default for control, logging and evidence generation. It can be  simply deployed by
customers through a Terraform workflow.
