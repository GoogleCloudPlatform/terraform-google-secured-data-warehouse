# Standalone Tutorial

This examples deploys the Secured data warehouse blueprint and the required infrastructure needed to deploy it.

The required infrastructure includes:

- Projects
  - Data Ingestion project
  - Non-confidential Data project
  - Data Governance project
  - Confidential Data project
  - External Artifact Registry project
- Artifact Registry
  - Docker Artifact registry
- Dataflow Templates
  - Java Cloud storage to Bigquery dlp de-identification Dataflow flex template
  - Java Bigquery to Bigquery dlp re-identification Dataflow flex template
- Networks
  - Data Ingestion Network
    - VPC with one subnetwork
    - Firewall rules
    - DNS configuration for Google private access
  - Confidential Data Network
    - VPC with one subnetwork
    - Firewall rules
    - DNS configuration for Google private access
- Logging
  - Log Sinks in all projects
  - Logging bucket in the data governance project
- Cloud KMS
  - A Cloud KMS Keyring
  - A Cloud KMS key
  - A traffic encryption key for DLP Templates

This example will be deployed at the `us-east4` location, to deploy in another location change the local `location` in example [main.tf](./main.tf#L18) file.

## Usage

- Copy `tfvars` by running `cp terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars` and update `terraform.tfvars` with values from your environment.
- Run `terraform init`
- Run `terraform plan` and review the plan.
- Run `terraform apply`

### Clean up

- Run `terraform destroy` to clean up your environment.

### Perimeter members list

To be able to see the resources protected the the VPC Service Controls Perimeters in the Google Cloud Console
you need to add your user in the variable `perimeter_additional_members` in the `terraform.tfvars` file.

### Sample data

The sample data use in this example is a csv file with fake credit card data.
For this example the input file has 10k records.

Each record has these values:

- Card Type Code
- Card Type Full Name
- Issuing Bank
- Card Number
- Card Holder's Name
- CVV/CVV2
- Issue Date
- Expiry Date
- Billing Date
- Card PIN
- Credit Limit

The de-identification Dataflow job will apply these DLP Crypto-based tokenization transformations to encrypt the data:

- [Deterministic encryption](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/transformations-reference#de) Transformation
  - Card Number
  - Card Holder's Name
  - CVV/CVV2
  - Expiry Date
- [Cryptographic hashing](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/transformations-reference#crypto-hashing) Transformation
  - Card PIN

### Taxonomy used

This example creates a Data Catalog taxonomy to enable [BigQuery column-level access controls](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/column-level-security-intro).

The taxonomy has three level: Confidential, Private, and Sensitive and access to a higher level grants also access to the lower levels

- **3_Confidential:** Most sensitive data classification. Significant damage to enterprise.
  - CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER
  - CARD_VERIFICATION_VALUE
  - **2_Private:** Data meant to be private. Likely to cause damage to enterprise.
    - PERSON_NAME
    - CREDIT_CARD_PIN
    - CARD_EXPIRY_DATE
    - **1_Sensitive:** Data not meant to be public.
      - CREDIT_LIMIT

## Requirements

These sections describe requirements for running this example.

### Software

Install the following dependencies:

- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) version 357.0.0 or later
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) version 0.13.7 or later
- [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)

### Service Account

To provision the resources of this module, create a service account
with the following IAM roles:

- Organization level
  - Access Context Manager Admin: `roles/accesscontextmanager.policyAdmin`
  - Billing Account User: `roles/billing.user`
  - Organization Policy Administrator: `roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin`
- Folder Level
  - Compute Network Admin: `roles/compute.networkAdmin`
  - Logging Admin: `roles/logging.admin`
  - Project Creator: `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`
  - Project Deleter: `roles/resourcemanager.projectDeleter`
  - Project IAM Admin: `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`
  - Service Usage Admin: `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`

As an alternative to granting the service account the `Billing Account User` role in organization,
it is possible to grant it [directly in the billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access#update-cloud-billing-permissions).

```sh
export SA_EMAIL=<YOUR-SA-EMAIL>
export BILLING_ACCOUNT=<YOUR-BILLING-ACCOUNT>

gcloud beta billing accounts add-iam-policy-binding "${BILLING_ACCOUNT}" \
--member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
--role="roles/billing.user"
```

You can use the [Project Factory module](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-project-factory) and the
[IAM module](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-iam) in combination to provision a
service account with the necessary roles applied.

The user using this service account must have the necessary roles, `Service Account User` and `Service Account Token Creator`, to [impersonate](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/impersonating-service-accounts) the service account.

You can run the following commands to assign roles to the service account:

```sh
export ORG_ID=<YOUR-ORG-ID>
export FOLDER_ID=<YOUR-FOLDER-ID>
export SA_EMAIL=<YOUR-SA-EMAIL>

gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding ${ORG_ID} \
--member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
--role="roles/accesscontextmanager.policyAdmin"

gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding ${ORG_ID} \
--member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
--role="roles/billing.user"

gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding ${ORG_ID} \
--member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
--role="roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin"

gcloud resource-manager folders \
add-iam-policy-binding ${FOLDER_ID} \
--member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
--role="roles/compute.networkAdmin"

gcloud resource-manager folders \
add-iam-policy-binding ${FOLDER_ID} \
--member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
--role="roles/logging.admin"

gcloud resource-manager folders \
add-iam-policy-binding ${FOLDER_ID} \
--member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
--role="roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator"

gcloud resource-manager folders \
add-iam-policy-binding ${FOLDER_ID} \
--member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
--role="roles/resourcemanager.projectDeleter"

gcloud resource-manager folders \
add-iam-policy-binding ${FOLDER_ID} \
--member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
--role="roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin"

gcloud resource-manager folders \
add-iam-policy-binding ${FOLDER_ID} \
--member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
--role="roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin"
```

### APIs

The following APIs must be enabled in the project where the service account was created:

- Access Context Manager API: `accesscontextmanager.googleapis.com`
- App Engine Admin API: `appengine.googleapis.com`
- Cloud Billing API: `cloudbilling.googleapis.com`
- Cloud Build API: `cloudbuild.googleapis.com`
- Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API: `cloudkms.googleapis.com`
- Cloud Pub/Sub API: `pubsub.googleapis.com`
- Cloud Resource Manager API: `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com`
- Compute Engine API: `compute.googleapis.com`
- Dataflow API: `dataflow.googleapis.com`
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) API: `iam.googleapis.com`
- BigQuery API: `bigquery.googleapis.com`

You can run the gcloud command to enable these APIs in the service account project

```sh
export PROJECT_ID=<SA-PROJECT-ID>

gcloud services enable \
accesscontextmanager.googleapis.com \
appengine.googleapis.com \
bigquery.googleapis.com \
cloudbilling.googleapis.com \
cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
cloudkms.googleapis.com \
pubsub.googleapis.com \
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \
compute.googleapis.com \
dataflow.googleapis.com \
iam.googleapis.com \
--project ${PROJECT_ID}
```

## Generate sample credit card .csv file

This examples uses a [csv file with sample data](../assets/cc_10000_records.csv) as input for the dataflow job.
You can create new files with different sizes using the [sample-cc-generator](helpers/sample-cc-generator/README.md) helper.
This new file must be placed in the [assets folder](../assets)
You need to change value of the local `cc_file_name` in the [main.tf](./main.tf#L28) file to use the new sample file:

```hcl
locals {
  ...
  cc_file_name = "cc_10000_records.csv"
  ...
```
