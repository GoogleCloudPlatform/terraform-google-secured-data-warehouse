# Enhanced Org Policies to Standalone Example

This examples deploys the *Secured Data Warehouse* blueprint [module](../../README.md).
Using this example you can choose between using existing projects or
letting the example create the required projects needed to deploy it.

Setting the variable `create_projects` to `true` will make the example create the four projects needed by the *Secured Data Warehouse*:

- Data Governance project.
- Data Ingestion project.
- Non-Confidential Data project.
- Confidential Data project.

### Organization Policies

This example will apply 4 organization policies at the project level for all projects.

- [org_domain_restricted_sharing](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/restricting-domains):
The Resource Manager provides a domain restriction constraint that can be used in organization policies to limit resource sharing based on domain.

- [org_enforce_bucket_level_access](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uniform-bucket-level-access): Allows you to uniformly control access to your Cloud Storage resources. When you enable uniform bucket-level access on a bucket, Access Control Lists (ACLs) are disabled, and only bucket-level Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions grant access to that bucket and the objects it contains.

- [org_enforce_detailed_audit_logging_mode](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/org-policy-constraints#audit-logging): When you apply the detailedAuditLoggingMode constraint, Cloud Audit Logs logs associated with Cloud Storage operations contain detailed request and response information. This constraint is recommended to be used in conjunction with Bucket Lock when seeking various compliances such as SEC Rule 17a-4(f), CFTC Rule 1.31(c)-(d), and FINRA Rule 4511(c).

- [org_enforce_public_access_prevention](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-access-prevention): Public access prevention protects Cloud Storage buckets and objects from being accidentally exposed to the public.


## Usage

To provision this example, run the following from within this directory:

- Copy `tfvars` by running `cp terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars` and update `terraform.tfvars` with values from your environment.
- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build
- `terraform destroy` to destroy the built infrastructure

### Clean up

- Run `terraform destroy` to clean up your environment.

### Perimeter members list

To be able to see the resources protected by the VPC Service Controls [Perimeters](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/service-perimeters) in the Google Cloud Console
you need to add your user in the variable `perimeter_additional_members`.

## Requirements

1. The [Secured data warehouse](../../README.md#requirements) module requirements to create the Secured data warehouse infrastructure.

If the projects are created by the example, instead of the project level roles listed in the main module [README](../../README.md#service_account) you will need the following roles in the folder in which the projects will be created:

- Logging Admin: `roles/logging.admin`
- Project Creator: `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`
- Project Deleter: `roles/resourcemanager.projectDeleter`
- Project IAM Admin: `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`
- Service Usage Admin: `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`

It will also be necessary to grant the `Billing Account User` role to the [service account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access#update-cloud-billing-permissions).

You can run the following `gcloud` command to assign `Billing Account User` role to the service account.

```sh
export SA_EMAIL=<YOUR-SA-EMAIL>
export BILLING_ACCOUNT=<YOUR-BILLING-ACCOUNT>

gcloud beta billing accounts add-iam-policy-binding "${BILLING_ACCOUNT}" \
--member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
--role="roles/billing.user"
```

The user using this service account must have the necessary roles, `Service Account User` and `Service Account Token Creator`, to [impersonate](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/impersonating-service-accounts) the service account.
