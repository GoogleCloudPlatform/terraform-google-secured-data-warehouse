# Bigquery Confidential Data Example

This example illustrates how to run a Flex Java re-identification Dataflow job in the Secured data warehouse and
how to use [Data Catalog policy tags](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/best-practices-policy-tags) to restrict access to confidential columns in the re-identified table.

It uses:

- The [Secured data warehouse](../../README.md) module to create the Secured data warehouse infrastructure,
- The [de-identification template](../../modules/de-identification-template/README.md) submodule to create the regional structured DLP template,
- The [Dataflow Flex Template Job](../../modules/dataflow-flex-job/README.md) submodule to deploy a Dataflow flex template re-identification job.
- The [Dataflow Flex Template Job](../../modules/dataflow-flex-job/README.md) submodule to deploy a Dataflow flex template de-identification job.

## Requirements

1. The [Secured data warehouse](../../README.md#requirements) module requirements to create the Secured data warehouse infrastructure.
1. A `crypto_key` and `wrapped_key` pair. Contact your Security Team to obtain the pair. The `crypto_key` location must be the same location used for the `location` variable. There is a [Wrapped Key Helper](../../helpers/wrapped-key/README.md) python script which generates a wrapped key.
1. The identity deploying the example must have permission to grant roles "roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyDecrypter" and "roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypter" in the KMS `crypto_key`. It will be granted to the Data Ingestion Dataflow worker service account and the Confidential Data Dataflow worker service account created by the Secured Data Warehouse module.
1. Pre-build Java Regional DLP De-identification and Re-identification flex templates. See [Flex templates](../../flex-templates/README.md) on how to create them.
1. The identity deploying the example must have permissions to grant role "roles/artifactregistry.reader" in the docker and python repos of the Flex templates.
1. You need to create network and subnetwork in the data ingestion project [configured for Private Google Access](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access).
1. You need to create network and subnetwork in the confidential project [configured for Private Google Access](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access).

### Firewall rules

- [All the egress should be denied](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/set-up-private-connectivity#configure-firewall).
- [Allow only Restricted API Egress by TPC at 443 port](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/set-up-private-connectivity#configure-firewall).
- [Allow only Private API Egress by TPC at 443 port](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/set-up-private-connectivity#configure-firewall).
- [Allow ingress Dataflow workers by TPC at ports 12345 and 12346](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/routes-firewall#example_firewall_ingress_rule).
- [Allow egress Dataflow workers by TPC at ports 12345 and 12346](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/routes-firewall#example_firewall_egress_rule).

### DNS configuration

- [Restricted Google APIs](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/set-up-private-connectivity#configure-routes).
- [Private Google APIs](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access).
- [Restricted gcr.io](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/set-up-gke#configure-dns).
- [Restricted Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/set-up-gke#configure-dns).

## Generate sample credit card .csv file

This examples uses a [csv file with sample data](./assets/cc_10000_records.csv) as input for the dataflow job.
You can create new files with different sizes using the [sample-cc-generator](../../helpers/sample-cc-generator/README.md) helper.
This new file must be placed in the [assets folder](./assets)
You need to change value of the local `cc_file_name` in the [main.tf](./main.tf#L27) file to use the new sample file:

```hcl
locals {
  ...
  cc_file_name = "cc_10000_records.csv"
  ...
```
